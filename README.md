# CHRISTINA MOSS - HOMEWORK 1 - CODE REFACTORING

## DESCRIPTION

Hello and welcome to my first homework assignment submittal. I hope this finds you in good health and spirits. My name is Christina and this is my code. 

I have completed this assignment regarding Code Refactoring to the best of my current ability. I have attempted to lay out the major parts of what I've done in the comment lines in both the html and css files. Below is a summary of what is to come.

## WHAT WAS DONE?

The items of importance in this code refactoring exercise were as follows: 

1. Making the code more accessible. In doing this, I made certain code elements more user-friendly by using semantics. This included changing many <div> items to <section> items, using <nav>, <header> and <footer> elements and removing the classes associated with them that were unnecessary. I have added alt text to the images and for the cover image, instead of the original "hero" class being just a background image, I have made this an html img with alt text and used the object-fit function to crop the image and fit just as it did in the original.

2. Making the code better organized and more readable. Many of the css classes and IDs were very repetitive and unneccesary. I combined some of the identical classes, changed the classes to IDs where they were referring to only one element, shortening the identifiers where they contained too many factors, and ordering the header tags.

3. Making sure the code was functional. One of the links was not active, I ensured this now works as intended. I continued to monitor the functionality as I edited the code further. 

4. Not changing the intended look or function. I realize this webpage was laid out as the original creator intended, it just needed some help. The page looks identical to what it did before, but now it works properly and the code it a little cleaner and more organized.

5. Scout Rule. I have definitely left this code a bit cleaner than it was before. By combining and removing certain classes and elements as necessary, I believe this is one clean piece of work. I hope you agree!

6. Commenting. Man, I commented the heck out of this. I tried to be as descriptive as possible with the work that was done. I hope it makes sense, and is helpful to understand my thought process.

## CONCLUSION

This is my first README file, and first homework assignment. I enjoyed organizing the code and figuring out ways to make it better. I'm sure it's not perfect, but I'm pretty proud at this first attempt. I hope you are proud too. I'm only going to get better from here! I promise.

Until next time,

Christina :)
