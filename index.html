    <!--The header was just a section with a class called .header. For accessbility, I have removed the .header class 
        and converted it into the <header> element. I have fixed one of the links that did not function properly and utilized 
        the <nav> element to identify that this section is used to navigate the page. The list elements were unnecessary. I have 
        removed them and just formatted them as links. It looks and functions the same way in the webpage, but the code is more 
        organized and simplified.-->

    <!--Each of the following boxes were identified as unique classes AND IDs, this was repetitive and unnecessary since they 
        are largely identical. I kept the ID tags since the navigation links use them, but combined all of the common css 
        properties into a single .content class. See css file for more details.-->

            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as they
                travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase
                your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

                class="float-right" />
            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an
                internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives
                you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing helps you
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right markets and
                increase your lead generation.

    <!--There was no reason for each of these sections to have their own classes. Their elements and formatting are identical. 
        I have combined them for ease. See css file for more information. The images now all have alt text as well, for accessibility. -->

            <h3>Lead Generation</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" alt="Lead Generation icon" />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly
                to your website.

            <h3>Brand Awareness</h3>
            <img src="./assets/images/brand-awareness.png" alt="Brand Awareness icon" />
            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and visibility
                for your business.

            <img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Cost Management icon" />
            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer
                need to advertise your page.

    <!--Much like the header, the footer should be assigned the <footer> tag, not have a new class assigned to it. I have fixed this.-->
